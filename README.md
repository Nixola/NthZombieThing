# NthZombieThing
This is a top-down shooter. Yes, there are N of them already.

I wanted to create a small camera lib to use in my future projects (I don't like using other people's code).
So, I started writing it, when I realized I needed some way to test it. This is how this thing's born.

Then I also created a small vector lib (vecturr) because I needed it in this game, and now I'm actually developing it beyond what it was meant to be. Writing games is fun!

Controls:
* WASD to move
* number keys to select weapon
* z,x,c to select a powerup after gaining a level
* 0 is the ultimate powerup, put in for testing. Do not use.

Weapons:
* Handgun. Doesn't autofire, deals moderate damage, has a moderate rate and a moderate spread.
* Uzi. Ridicolously OP as of now, I should balance it sooner or later. Maybe I'll add another super-duper weapon called TestKiller or something.
* Sniper Rifle. Also OP, but not intentionally. High damage, low rate and ZERO spread.

What's to say here? Oh right, an incoming features list!
* None! I'll probably accept feature requests though

If anyone wanted to contribute, I could really use some art:
* The most needed thing is the art for the powerups. They should be 90x90 or 96x96 (90x90 is better) icons, representing something related to their effect:
  * increase max HPs
  * increase damage
  * increase speed
  * decrease spread
  * increase critical chance
  * increase critical damage
  * greatly improves a random weapon
  * strengthen the enemies
* I might need some art for the player and the zombies as well (which should be mainly circular)
* and maybe some art for the weapons? Small, 16x16 icons for each (or maybe not, not sure they'd fit) and graphics for them in the actual game.

That's it. Yay!
